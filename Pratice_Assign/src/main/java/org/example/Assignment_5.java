// JAR and WAR? What different build tools are available?

  //  Jar(Java ARchive) is a compressed file that contains all different packages
  //A WAR (Web Application Archive) file is used to package web applications,
    // including servlets, JSPs, HTML files, and other web components,
    // and is deployed on a servlet container like Apache Tomcat.

// What is Encapsulation, Inheritance, polymorphism, interface, abstract classes?
//Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the objectâ€™s components.
// Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can acquire the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.
// Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms.
// An interface is a reference type in Java that contains only abstract methods and constants, used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance.
// An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain abstract methods (without implementation) as well as concrete methods, serving as a base for other classes.

// Create setters and getters for different class variables for class Employee?

    public void Employees(){

        String First_name ;
        String Last_name ;
        String Email;
        int Salary;

    }

// Read what are getters & setters, what are access modifiers, what is difference between public, private, protected and default?

// Understand the access modifier usage when applied at class level, method level and variable level?
// Create setters and getters for different class variables for class Customer, with customerID, customerName, customerAddress, customerZipcode, customerName and create 5 different objects using setters & getters. Write these objects to a file ?
// Convert the customer objects into table and write it to a file
// Convert the customer objects into JSON format and write it to a file
// Write a java code to insert 5 elements into array with for loop
// Write a java program to retrieve 5 elements in an array
// Write a java code to retrieve an element based on the index
